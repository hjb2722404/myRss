          "description": "对大多数人来说，听是一件毫不费力的事，以至于我们很难理解大脑的听觉系统需要为此处理和理顺多少信息。大脑必须接收传入的声音，将其转化为我们感知到的声学对象：朋友的声音、狗的吠叫、滴滴答答的雨声。大脑必须从背景噪音中提取出相关的声音。它还需要确定两个不同的人所到的单词具有相同的语义，同时还要区分这些声音，评估音高、音调和其他特性。\n\n\n传统的神经处理模型认为，当我们听到声音时，听觉系统会提取其中一些简单的特征，然后再将它们组合成更加复杂和抽象的表示。举例来说，这个过程需要大脑将某人说话的声音先转换成音素，然后是音节，最后是单词。\n\n\n但是今年 8 月发表在《Cell》上的一篇论文显示，一组研究人员对该模型提出了不同意见，他们认为大脑的听觉系统同时并行处理声音和语音。他们的研究结果表明，大脑如何理解语音与科学家的预测大相径庭，耳朵听到的信号在声音处理最早期阶段就被分流到不同的大脑通路，有时甚至绕过了部分大脑区域，那些区域之前被认为是构建复杂声音表示的重要部分。\n\n\n这项工作为大脑如何快速有效地解开重叠的听觉刺激流提供了新的解释。这一发现不仅对关于语音处理的成熟理论提出了质疑；它还挑战了关于整个听觉系统如何工作的想法。关于对声音的感知，大部分主流观点都是基于与我们所了解的视觉系统中执行的计算进行类比。但越来越多的证据，包括最近对语音的研究，都暗示听觉处理的工作方式非常不同——以至于科学家开始重新思考听觉系统各个部分的功能，以及这对我们可以解读如此丰富的音声环境意味着什么。",

          "description": "由于偷猎问题，部分野生动物管理机构采取移除犀牛角的方法消除被偷猎的首要原因。事实证明，演化也出现了一个类似的解决方案。\n\n莫桑比克长达 15 年的内战引发了偷猎狂潮，最终杀死了一个国家公园中 90% 的大象。该公园后来出现了无牙大象。这一现象令人感到惊讶，因为象牙在大象觅食和防御掠食者方面发挥着重要的作用。现在研究人员发现，象牙的缺失是基因突变的结果，甚至确定了背后可能的基因。\n\n在莫桑比克内战期间，Gorongosa 国家公园的大象数量从 2,542 头下降到仅  242 头。剩余的大象中包含了相当数量没有象牙的大象。模型显示，无象牙大象比有象牙大象存活的可能性要高五倍。\n\n引人注目的是，无象牙只见于雌性。这是一个不寻常的模式。雄性只有一个 X 染色体，而雌性有两个。因此，任何隐性突变——如果存在基因的正常副本就不会产生影响——更有可能出现在雄性身上，因为它们只有一个副本，所以不会有正常的副本。而即使存在正常的基因副本，显性突变也会产生影响，这可以解释这种现象在雌性中的出现，但是我们应该也会在雄性身上看到它。\n\n这种令人迷惑的现象是一种复杂的遗传模式，这种突变以显性方式导致可见的变化，又以隐形的方式导致死亡。因此，显性无象牙解释了为什么我们看到了没有象牙的雌性。但隐性致死则意味着任何没有象牙的雄性都会在发育过程中死亡。因为没有带有突变的雄性，所以雌性不可能得到两个突变的 X 染色体副本，因为总有一个 X 染色体是来自父亲。\n\n如果你学过孟德尔的理论，那么你就有可能在对这种遗传的研究中预测出其后代的状况。对于没有象牙的母亲来说，她的一半雄性后代会遗传突变并死亡。这意味着雄性的出生率应该是雌性的一半。在雌性后代中，有一半应该遗传了这种突变，所以没有象牙。新的研究证实，这正是 Gorongosa 国家公园中大象的遗传模式。",
